* DBD describes the complete physi
* A database has a single physical structure defined by a DBD but the application programs that process it can have different views of the database. These views are called application data structure and are defined in the PSB.cal structure of the database once all the segments have been defined.
* Program Communication Block (PCB) that describes the database Type, Name, Key-Length, and Processing Option.
